# Arxiv Audio

[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) has been a blessing to many of us. We have taken it one step further. With the help of [Arxiv Audio](https://arxivaudio.herokuapp.com/) you can search for
any paper that is present on Arxiv and convert it into an audio-book. 

The architecture of Arxiv audio is very simple and it is open-sourced so that people like you can help us take it one step further. 

The objective behind this project is very simple, many people like me are tend to get overwhelmed by the number of papers that they have to go through for projects,
so what if we could simplify the reading process and bring in an audio so that you could easily listen to a paper while doing some other work. Without the need to sit and allot a separate time to go through the paper you can easily get an idea and the next time it will be easier for you, when you read that same paper.

## Use

You can use the web-app of Arxiv audio but due to gTTS having less tokens on the free version we suggest that if would be better if you clone this repository and then run the module as follows:

```
pip install requirements.txt
python app.py
```
With that you will be able to use the simple interface on your local machine and use it to your heart's content without being rate limited by gTTs.

## Update

Its currently live at [Arxiv Audio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Archan/ArXivAudio) using espnet and tacotron instead of gTTs.

### Contribution

We are always looking for active collaborators who can help us with web development and can improve the overall visual appeal.
